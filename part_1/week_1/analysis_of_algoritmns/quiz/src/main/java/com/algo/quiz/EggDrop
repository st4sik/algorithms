Egg drop. Suppose that you have an nn-story building (with floors 1 through nn) and plenty of eggs.
An egg breaks if it is dropped from floor TT or higher and does not break otherwise.
Your goal is to devise a strategy to determine the value of TT given the following limitations on
the number of eggs and tosses:

Version 0: 1 egg, \le T≤T tosses.
Version 1: \sim 1 \lg n∼1lgn eggs and \sim 1 \lg n∼1lgn tosses.
Version 2: \sim \lg T∼lgT eggs and \sim 2 \lg T∼2lgT tosses.
Version 3: 22 eggs and \sim 2 \sqrt n∼2n tosses.
Version 4: 22 eggs and \le c \sqrt T≤c
T tosses for some fixed constant cc.

Version 0: sequential search.
Version 1: binary search.
Version 2: find an interval containing TT of size \le 2T≤2T, then do binary search.
Version 3: find an interval of size \sqrt n
n, then do sequential search. Note: can be improved to \sim \sqrt{2n}∼2n tosses.
Version 4: 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + t \; \sim \; \frac{1}{2} t^21+2+3+…+t∼ 1/2*t^2. Aim for c = 2 \sqrt{2}
