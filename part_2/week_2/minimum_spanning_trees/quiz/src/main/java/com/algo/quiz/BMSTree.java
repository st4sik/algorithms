/**
 * Bottleneck minimum spanning tree. Given a connected edge-weighted graph, design an efficient
 * algorithm to find a minimum bottleneck spanning tree. The bottleneck capacity of a spanning tree
 * is the weights of its largest edge. A minimum bottleneck spanning tree is a spanning tree of
 * minimum bottleneck capacity.
 *
 * Hint: prove that an MST is a minimum bottleneck spanning tree.
 *
 * Extra challenge: Compute a minimum bottleneck spanning tree in linear time in the worst case.
 * Assume that you can compute the median of nn keys in linear time in the worst case.
