 * Monotonic shortest path. Given an edge-weighted digraph G, design an ElogE algorithm to find a
 * monotonic shortest path from s to every other vertex. A path is monotonic if the sequence of edge
 * weights along the path are either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.
 *
 * Hint: relax edges in ascending order to find a best monotonically increasing path; relax edges in
 * descending order to find a best monotonically decreasing path.
