 * Second shortest path. Given an edge-weighted digraph and let P be a shortest path from vertex s
 * to vertex t. Design an ElogV algorithm to find a path other than P from s to t that is as short
 * as possible. Assume all of the edge weights are strictly positive.
 *
 * Hint: compute the shortest path distances from s to every vertex and the shortest path distances
 * from every vertex to t.
