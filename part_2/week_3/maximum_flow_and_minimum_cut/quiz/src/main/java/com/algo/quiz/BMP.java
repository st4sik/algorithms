/**
 * Perfect matchings in k-regular bipartite graphs. Suppose that there are n men and n women at a
 * dance and that each man knows exactly k women and each woman knows exactly k men (and
 * relationships are mutual). Show that it is always possible to arrange a dance so that each man
 * and woman are matched with someone they know.
 *
 * Hint: formulate the bipartite matching problem as a maxflow problem; find a (fractional) feasible
 * flow of value n; conclude that there is a perfect matching.
