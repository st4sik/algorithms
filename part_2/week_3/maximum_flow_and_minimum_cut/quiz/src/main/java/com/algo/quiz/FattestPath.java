 * Fattest path. Given an edge-weighted digraph and two vertices ss and tt, design an ElogE
 * algorithm to find a fattest path from s to t. The bottleneck capacity of a path is the minimum
 * weight of an edge on the path. A fattest path is a path such that no other path has a higher
 * bottleneck capacity.
 *
 * Hint: design a linear-time subroutine that takes a real-number T and determines if there is a
 * path from s to t of bottleneck capacity greater than or equal to T
