/**
 * Maximum weight closure problem. A subset of vertices S in a digraph is closed if there are no
 * edges pointing from S to a vertex outside S. Given a digraph with weights (positive or negative)
 * on the vertices, find a closed subset of vertices of maximum total weight.
 *
 * Hint: formulate as a mincut problem; assign edge (v, w)(v,w) a weight of infinity if there is an
 * edge from v to w in the original digraph.
