/**
 * Cyclic rotations. Two strings s and t are cyclic rotations of one another if they have the same
 * length and s consists of a suffix of t followed by a prefix of t. For example, "suffixsort" and
 * "sortsuffix" are cyclic rotations.
 *
 * Given nn distinct strings, each of length L, design an algorithm to determine whether there
 * exists a pair of distinct strings that are cyclic rotations of one another. For example, the
 * following list of n = 12 strings of length L = 10 contains exactly one pair of strings
 * ("suffixsort" and "sortsuffix") that are cyclic rotations of one another.
 *
 * Hint: define a fingerprint of a string in such a way that two strings are cyclic rotations of one
 * another if and only if they have the same fingerprint.
 *
 * Signing bonus: design an algorithm to find the fingerprint of a string of length L in time
 * proportional to L in the worst case.
