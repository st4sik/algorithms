/**
 * Tandem repeat. A tandem repeat of a base string b within a string s is a substring of s
 * consisting of at least one consecutive copy of the base string b. Given b and s, design an
 * algorithm to find a tandem repeat of b within s of maximum length. Your algorithm should run in
 * time proportional to M + N, where M is length of b and N is the length s.
 *
 * For example, if s is "abcabcababcaba" and b is "abcab", then "abcababcab" is the tandem substring
 * of maximum length (2 copies).
 *
 * Hint: use Knuth-Morris-Pratt.
