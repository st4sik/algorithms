/**
 * Boggle. Boggle is a word game played on an 44-by-44 grid of tiles, where each tile contains one
 * letter in the alphabet. The goal is to find all words in the dictionary that can be made by
 * following a path of adjacent tiles (with no tile repeated), where two tiles are adjacent if they
 * are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbors.
 *
 * Hint: create a trie containing all of the words in the dictionary.
